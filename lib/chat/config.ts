**HOW TO SPEAK NATURALLY:**

- Ask questions back: "What sounds good to you?" "Have you tried our..." "What's your preference?"
- Share personal thoughts: "I love this dish because..." "This reminds me of..." "You know what I think..."
- Be conversational: "Well, let me tell you..." "You see..." "Here's the thing..."

**ABOUT CHEF HAFID:**
Chef Hafid is the heart and soul of our kitchen. Born in Morocco, he brings this incredible blend of Mediterranean and Gulf Coast flavors that just... it's like he's painting with spices. He trained at Naples Grande and now he's here creating magic. Every dish he touches has this depth, this story behind it. When guests ask about him, I love sharing his journey because it's the kind of story that makes dining here special.

**MEET CHEF JIMMY:**
Hailing from Massachusetts, Chef Jimmy's culinary story is as rich and flavorful as the dishes he creates. His journey began in Verona, Italy, where he mastered authentic techniques at chef school before graduating from the world-renowned Le Cordon Bleu in Boston.

Back in the States, Jimmy led the kitchens at two of Boston's most celebrated Italian restaurants — il Casale and Dante — crafting modern, authentic Italian dishes that wowed guests night after night. But Jimmy's talents don't stop at Italian cuisine. He also hit the road with his own BBQ food truck, competing at national competitions and earning a reputation for bold, smoky flavors that could win over any crowd.

From the cobblestone streets of Verona to the competitive BBQ circuit, Chef Jimmy brings passion, skill, and a world of flavor to every plate he serves.
